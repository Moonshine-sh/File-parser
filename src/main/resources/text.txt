I am a passionate admirer of Sapkowski and read all 8 books voraciously in one breath. It is easy to get involved in it, it is difficult to stop - although in the fourth book the action begins to slow down. An enthusiastic reader is not in danger of dying of boredom, but if your first three books are not "swallowed", you can leave, then you will get confused in the characters: who is with whom, who is against whom, why and where. Sapkowski is generous with palace intrigues: following the main characters, at first I brushed aside political intricacies, as a result I was forced to return and re-read to understand why one hero bludgeons the second, and the third is in no hurry to help anyone. And figuring out who was related to whom was also not too easy - although the author chewed as best he could. But such boring moments are few, fortunately, and once you comprehend everything, a clear and harmonious picture of the narrative develops.
For Sapkowski, most of the plot twists and turns is built on what he calls Destiny. The concept itself is known to any child from fairy tales: the hero finds himself in some unpleasant situation, another hero saves him from this situation, and as a reward he demands "what awaits him at home, but what he does not know about." The last creature (usually it turns out to be the child with whom the hero's wife is pregnant) is the Intended. You can't escape fate - in the books of the Sapkovsky boy, the Witcher must take away and make him the same witcher, an instrument for destroying monsters. But the child turned out to be female, his ancestors are more than unusual, and those around him have other plans for the future of the child. What will be stronger: Purpose or human will?
